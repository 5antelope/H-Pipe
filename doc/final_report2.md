# H-Piper: A Deep Learning Framework in Halide
\- Lei Sun, Yang Wu

## SUMMARY
**H-Piper** is our final project for 15418.

We proposed H-Piper, a powerful, flexible, and highly-balanced framework for deep learning Nets. User can easily generate customized neural networks by providing config files. We have build-in neural networks like

## SUMMARY

A short (no more than a paragraph) project summary. If applicable, the summary should list your project deliverables (including what you plan to show at the parallelism competition) and what machines they ran on.


## BACKGROUND

Describe the algorithm, application, or system you parallelized in computer science terms. (Recall our discussion from the last day of class.) Figure(s) would be really useful here.

## APPROACH

Tell us how your implementation works. Your description should be sufficiently detailed to provide the course staff a basic understanding of your approach. Again, it might be very useful to include a figure here illustrating components of the system and/or their mapping to parallel hardware.

## RESULTS

How successful were you at achieving your goals? We expect results sections to differ from project to project, but we expect your evaluation to be very thorough (your project evaluation is a great way to demonstrate you understood topics from this course).
