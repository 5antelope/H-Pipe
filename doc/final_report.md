# H-Piper: A Deep Learning Framework in Halide
\- Lei Sun, Yang Wu

## SUMMARY 

**H-Piper** is our final project for 15418.

We proposed H-Piper, a powerful, flexible, and highly-balanced framework for deep learning Nets. User can easily generate customized image pipelines by providing config files. We tested our framework on VGG and Inception Network on latedays node. With our 10 basic layers, we were able to implemente vgg network and inception networks (incompleted). The idea of our project is given network definitions and weights, H-Piper would build the network and run forward.


## BACKGROUND

Describe the algorithm, application, or system you parallelized in computer science terms. (Recall our discussion from the last day of class.) Figure(s) would be really useful here.

## APPROACH

Tell us how your implementation works. Your description should be sufficiently detailed to provide the course staff a basic understanding of your approach. Again, it might be very useful to include a figure here illustrating components of the system and/or their mapping to parallel hardware.

## RESULTS

How successful were you at achieving your goals? We expect results sections to differ from project to project, but we expect your evaluation to be very thorough (your project evaluation is a great way to demonstrate you understood topics from this course).
